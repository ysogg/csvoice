# csvoice
Uses TensorFlow.js voice recognition to capture and recognise input (ripped from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzWcaLkCy1w).

Recognised input then executes different macros for moving and such to play CSGO

### RUNNING
- node server.js (backend)
- npm start (frontend react app)

### TODO
- Train new model with updated words (Currently implementing)
- Finish movement macros (1/2 done)
- Add mouse input macros for aiming
