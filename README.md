# csvoice
Uses TensorFlow.js voice recognition to capture and recognise input (ripped from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzWcaLkCy1w).

Recognised input then executes different macros for moving and such to play CSGO

### TODO
- Train new model with updated words
- Finish movement macros
- Add mouse input macros for aiming
